# A Simple Script Repository (Repo)


## Design Notes
This repo is designed to contain some simple CLI-based quality-of-life scripts
that can be run on your local machine.

Unless otherwise noted, instructions (setup, how-to's, et cetera) will live on the scripts themselves
because scripts may have different use cases or purposes.

Example:
- Screenshot cleanup
